LEARNING OUTCOMES:-

After successful completion of the project, I learned about:

1.Understand the architecture and workflow of React with Vite as a modern frontend framework.

2.Apply React concepts such as components, props, state, and hooks in real-time applications.

3.Analyze the performance benefits of Vite including fast refresh and optimized builds.

4.Evaluate code quality using ESLint and follow best practices for scalable frontend development.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
